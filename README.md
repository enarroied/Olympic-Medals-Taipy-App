# ðŸ¥‡ðŸ¥ˆðŸ¥‰ Olympic medals

## Note About Medium Article

If you came here from [this Medium article I wrote about Taipy 3.1](https://medium.com/gitconnected/discover-taipys-3-1-application-builder-5b8333f2c184), I've changed (improved and refactored) the code ever since. For reference, I keep [this branch](https://github.com/enarroied/Olympic-Medals-Taipy-App/tree/taipy_3.1), but I recommend you take the current version as a reference. **The structure of the dashboard didn't change** (except the table with data by Olympics).

## Changes Made in June 2025

I refactored and updated the dashboard, here is a summary of what I've done (may not be extensive):

* Updated data to include Paris 2024 results (I updated the Kaggle dataset)
* Updated the requirements, tested it: No errors, no warnings :)
* I changed the input files: from CSV to parquet files. Three main reasons:
  * File Size (for the bigger file only): this would be neglectable in most cases, but since I upload this dashboard to a free plan website, size matters!
  * I/O speed: pandas reads parquet faster than CSV
  * parquet retains data types
* I **precomputed data**. This is the biggest performance gain, by precomputing certain aggregates beforehand, the dashboard doesn't need to compute them for every filter change
* Change data types in the pandas DataFrames: I added `pd.categorical` data types to make the DataFrames more efficient
* Created parameter files for the long selector lists (also, these files are automatically created from a notebook that creates the parquet files)
* Separated the code in several smaller files, broke the functions into smaller units to have cleaner code
* Moved all initial values to `main.py`, removed duplicates, created an `on_init` function
* Made the table smaller (100 --> 20 rows), put it in an `expandable` block to avoid loading it from start.

## Introduction and Context

Welcome to **Olympic Medals**, a simple Taipy dashboard that shows information about Olympic medals awarded from the beginning of modern Olympic games. The dashboard has two tabs:
****
* A tab shows aggregated data for all Olympic medals
* A second tab focuses on medals won by Olympic committees (countries, but also special committees, such as the Refugee committee and so on)

The following video presents the dashboard:

**Context**: This is a demonstration application. I coded it to illustrate how to use **Taipy 3.1**. Coding this application allowed me to compare it with previous versions of Taipy, I coded a [similar dashboard about wine production in France](https://github.com/enarroied/taipy_wine_app) using Taipy 3.0.

**However, this dashboard has evolved to use later versions of Taipy**.

I chose to create a dashboard about the Olympic Games because 2024 is an Olympic year in Paris, and I live in France.

The main change of Taipy 3.1 is the way you apply the GUI elements. They replaced their unique Markdown syntax with a more pythonic system that relies on functions. This is what I wanted to test. This project does **not** use Taipy Core.


## Features

* Multi-Page Dashboard: Switch between tabs; the application has two pages.
* Several types of charts: Bar charts, sunburst charts, line charts, choropleth maps and grid charts.
* Dynamic Data Updates: The dashboard dynamically updates data based on the selected year and area type. 
* The app has different types of selectors.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. You can install them using the following:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The app uses Pandas and Plotly.


## Data

This application uses data from 2 CSV files. You can find them in the `data` repository.

Both datasets are available on Kaggle with complete references:

* [Olympic medals](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericnarro/all-olympic-medals-until-2024-before-paris-games) has all the medals (gold, silver, bronze) awarded at all Olympics.
* [Olympic cities](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ericnarro/olympic-cities-summary) has the geographical information about the Olympic cities (the app has maps). It also has some summary information about each Olympic game.
